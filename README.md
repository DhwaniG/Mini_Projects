Explanation: In this Program, a Bank System is Made with the help of OOPs concept. There are two classes Parent class as user and child class as Bank.
##### 1. Parent class : User
    1. Holds details about a user.
    2. Has a function to show the user details. 
##### 2. child class : Bank
    1. Store details about the account balance.
    2. Stores details about the amount.

In addition to that, a withdrawal is done of 200 rupees which is reflecting in the current balance as 1800.Then an Example of Insufficient Funds is also displayed.
